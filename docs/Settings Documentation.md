## Settings documentation
### General 
- **Threshold for notes to record in edit mode**: Select a requirement for notes to be recorded in live preview and source mode.
	- Require edits means you should at least type anything or delete anything, even just a space.
	- Require focus time means you should leave the note under edit mode over 1 minute.
	- If require none above, the recorder will track all files you opened under edit mode.
 - **Notes to record while quiting editing mode**: Select the behavior when switching a note from editing mode to reading mode.
	- Editing mode includes live preview and source mode.
	- If recording current note only, other notes may not be automactically recorded if you don\'t manually record.

### Focus Mode

When you are editing the notes, the number of edits you made, your edited words, the time you are on editing, etc. These statistics will automatically be tracked, and be recorded if you specify them in the wordflow recording syntax. 

However, since [version 1.5.0](https://github.com/LeCheenaX/WordFlow-Tracker/releases/tag/1.5.0), the focus mode is introduced to track more about the time.

In focus mode, the tracker will not only track the statistics in edit mode, but also the time you spent on each note in reading mode. This mainly does 3 things:
- record the reading time for each note
- record the editing time for each note, and the total time of editing and reading
- record other statistics in edit mode

> Note: moreover, the timer willl **no longer be interrupted** if you click elsewhere than the note in Obsidian, in focus mode. If not in focus mode, the timer will suspend immediately if you click the side pane, the ribbon, the settings, etc.

- **To enter focus mode**, kindly click the "play" button in the widget. 

- **In the focus mode**, the timer will automatically pause if idled for a long time. You can also manually pause the timer to suspend the focusing, and take a rest.

- **To quit focus mode**, you can kindly click the "save" button. And the statistics will automatically be recorded after quiting.

- **Auto-resume after idle pause**: When enabled, focus mode will automatically resume tracking after an idle pause without requiring manual intervention. This ensures continuous time tracking even during brief interruptions or breaks.

### Recorder
- **Create**: Create a new recorder so that the edit stats in tracker will be additionally recorded. Common usages are as followed:
	- Create a recorder for another periodic note: current recorder will record to daily note, and you create an additional one to record to monthly note. 
 	- Create a recorder for a different recording type: current recorder will record edits per note as table rows to your daily note, and you create another recorder to record total edits to the YAML of daily notes.

- **Rename**: Rename your recorders.
- **Delete**: Delete the current recorder and abandon its settings. 
#### Recorder Basics
- **Periodic note folder:** Set the folder for daily notes or weekly note to place, which should correspond to the same folder of Obsidian daily note plugin and of templater plugin(if installed).
	- **Enable dynamic folder:** Record the note to a dynamic folder rather than a static folder. If enabled, the folder must be in a [moment compatible format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).
	
	 	| Dynamic folder format  | Corresponding folder in vault | Periodic note format | Note path in vault                |
		| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
		| [Daily Notes/]YYYY-MM | Daily Notes/2025-03           | YYYY-MM-DD           | Daily Notes/2025-03/2025-03-21.md  |
		| [Monthly Notes/]YYYY  | Monthly Notes/2025            | MMM YYYY             | Monthly Notes/2025/Mar 2025.md     |

- **Periodic note format:** Set the file name for newly created daily notes or weekly note, which should correspond to the same format setting of Obsidian daily note plugin and of templater plugin(if installed).
- **Template plugin:**
	- If you are using templater folder template feature, the default option should be selected, which will delegate the template applying to templater plugin.
 	- If you have your own method(scripts or other plugins) of applying templates after creating note in the folder, kindly also use the default option. You can ignore the templater plugin not enabled prompt in this case. 
  	- If you are using the obsidian core plugin "templates", select the "templates" option. This will apply the template you specified to periodic notes. 
#### Recording Settings
- **Record content type:** Select a type of content to record on specified notes. Currently, table and bullet list are supported.
	- Note: when using a table format, the modified note must be at the first column.  
- **Insert to position:** If using a custom position, the start position and end position must exist and be unique in periodic note! Make sure your template is correctly applied while creating new periodic note.
- **Wordflow recording syntax:** Used for customizaing recording content. The regular expressions are supported with '${modifiedNote}', you can also generate link to the note by using a '[[${modifiedNote}]]'.

#### Supported String Interpolations
